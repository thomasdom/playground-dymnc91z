# Introduction

This Java template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```java runnable
// { autofold
public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {
// }

String message = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(message);

//{ autofold
}

}
//}
```

# Define meaningful names

## Avoid encodings and mental mapping

## In practice

### Class names

### Method names

## Best practices

### Don't try to impress

Do not try to impress by demonstrating enormous complexity to the reader. Instead, try to impress by showing inherent simplicity.
The reader of your code must be impressed by how the code he/she is currently reading is simple to understand. The reader should feel that he/she can implement your code easily. 

### Add meaningful context

# Functions

# Comments

# Formatting

# Objects and Data Structures

# Error Handling

# Boundaries

# Classes
