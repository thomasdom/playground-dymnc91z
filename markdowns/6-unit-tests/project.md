# Microproject: Prime Printer

@[Refactor the `PrimePrinter` class to comply with best practices:]({"stubs": ["PrimePrinter.java"], "command": "echo 'TECHIO> success true'", "project": "primeprinter"})

The project theory is explained [here](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf).
But you should be able to refactor it without going into deep details.

**HINTS:**

- Use comments to figure out what the code does
- Rename properly variables
- Split code into several functions
- You should create other classes to group related content
